# Digit-recognition-with-Tensorflow

Welcome to my Handwritten Digit Recognition project! 

This project was created as a part of my Msc studies at Skema. The goal of this project is to use Tensorflow to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits. 

In this repository, you will find the "CNN_Training_test.ipynb" notebook which contains the code for creating and training the CNN model. Additionally, the "CNN_Deployment.ipynb" notebook is provided, which demonstrates how the trained model can be deployed for prediction on new images of handwritten digits.

Overall this project would give a good understanding about image recognition as well as Tensorflow library which is widely used for ML problems .
